#AEROCRASH COMPUTER GRAPHICS PROJECT
A 2D graphics-based Aerocrash game  is a great start for a student who has starts to learn the subject computer graphics & visualization. The development of the game provides good large scope to learn computer graphics from scratch. We used large number of OpenGL utility toolkit to implement the algorithm. The program written also includes C++ language.

This AEROCRASH GAME project is a collision evasion process implemented in the form of a game. Here the user is allowed to control the movement of the plane through a collision course. 

The objective is to evade the obstacles and travel as far as possible. The planeâ€™s upward movement is controlled by the left mouse button. Holding and pressing the left mouse button takes the plane higher and releasing the button results in the plane descending down. As the distance covered increases the speed of the plane increases. The main obstacles are buildings and clouds. The user must make sure that no part of the plane touches either the clouds or the tall buildings. The plane is also equipped with a booster which the user can activate with the right mouse button. The booster makes the plane travel at a faster pace.
